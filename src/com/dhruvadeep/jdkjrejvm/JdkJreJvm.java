//        JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program.
//
//        When you run the Java program, Java compiler first compiles your Java code to bytecode. Then, the JVM
//        translates bytecode into native machine code (set of instructions that a computer's CPU executes directly).
//
//        Java is a platform-independent language. It's because when you write Java code, it's ultimately written for
//        JVM but not your physical machine (computer). Since JVM â€‹executes the Java bytecode which is platform-independent,
//        Java is platform-independent.


//        JAVA PROGRAM =(JAVA COMPILER)=> JAVA BYTECODE =(JVM)=> MACHINE CODE =(CPU)=> OUTPUT





//JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a software package that provides Java class libraries,
// Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components that are required to run Java applications.

//JRE is the superset of JVM.




//JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit required to develop applications in Java. When you download
//JDK, JRE is also downloaded with it.

//In addition to JRE, JDK also contains a number of development tools (compilers, JavaDoc, Java Debugger, etc).
